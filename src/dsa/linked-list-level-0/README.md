# Linked Lists (Level 0)

Master the fundamentals of linked lists, a dynamic data structure where elements are stored in nodes connected through pointers.

## Topics Covered

- **Design Linked List** - Implementing a complete linked list class
- **Linked List Cycle** - Detecting cycles using Floyd's algorithm
- **Middle of the Linked List** - Finding the middle element efficiently
- **Reverse Linked List** - Reversing the order of nodes

## Key Concepts

- Node structure and pointer manipulation
- Traversal techniques
- Two-pointer approach (slow and fast pointers)
- Memory management
- Cycle detection algorithms
